# Introduction

The object of study of this project concerns the classification of a set of entries retrieved from the website delicious.com into a list of topics. The dataset is called [DeliciousMIL](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/DeliciousMIL%3A+A+Data+Set+for+Multi-Label+Multi-Instance+Learning+with+Instance+Labels). In this dataset, the documents from the webpages were collected, classified into one or more classes from the [labels.txt](https://github.com/Eleni170/multi-delicious/blob/master/Data/labels.txt) file and split to train and test data. Every record is matched to a list with length the number of classes and each item in the list shows whether the record belongs (1) or doesn't belong (0) to class[item]. This information exists at [train-label.dat](https://github.com/Eleni170/multi-delicious/blob/master/Data/train-label.dat) for the training set and at [test-label.dat](https://github.com/Eleni170/multi-delicious/blob/master/Data/test-label.dat) for the test set.

The files with the 2 sets ([train-data.dat](https://github.com/Eleni170/multi-delicious/blob/master/Data/train-data.dat), [test-data.dat](https://github.com/Eleni170/multi-delicious/blob/master/Data/test-data.dat)) have a specific format. At the beginning of every record there is an indication of the number of sentences n in the documents specified at <n> and an indication of the number of words w for every sentence specified at <w>. Moreover, all the words of the documents have been used for the creation of a vocabulary that maps every word to a unique id ([vocabs.txt](https://github.com/Eleni170/multi-delicious/blob/master/Data/vocabs.txt)). An example of this format is :
  
    <2> <8> 6705 5997 8310 3606 674 8058 5044 4836 <4> 4312 5154 8310 4225
    <n> <w> id id id id id id id id <w> id id id id

As an additional step we preprocessed the dataset in order to fit with our needs for training and testing. We investigated 3 different topics using this dataset: learning from Multi-Label data, Multi-Instance learning and class imbalance. In the next section, we present the results of our investigation.

# Text processing

At first we preprocessed the text documents to obtain numerical features. For each word we counted the occurance at each document. The dataset was converted to a 2d matrix with dimensions number_of_documents x number_of_words where each node showed number of times a document i has the word j. Using this convertion, each word is treated as a feature. For this implementation we used ```read_train``` function from [data_processing](https://github.com/Eleni170/multi-delicious/blob/master/processing-text/data_processing.py).

```
  def read_train(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        line = f.readline()
        docs = []
        docs_bin = []
        while line:
            line = line.rstrip('\n').split()
            L = []
            for i in line:
                try:
                    L.append(int(i))
                except:
                    continue
            docs.append(np.array(L))

            words_bin = np.zeros(8520)
            for i in L:
                words_bin[i] += 1

            docs_bin.append(words_bin)
            line = f.readline()
        docs = np.array(docs)
        docs_bin = np.array(docs_bin)
    return docs_bin, docs
```

It is known that in large corpuses some words will be very present that don't carry such meaningful information about the content of the document. Hence, the classifier would treat very well those frequent words and ignore other important tokens for classification. For that reason, we normalized our feature vectors as a next step.

```
def tfIdf(docs_bin):
    tf_transformer = TfidfTransformer(use_idf=True).fit(docs_bin)
    X_train_tf = tf_transformer.transform(docs_bin)
    return X_train_tf
```

Tfâ€“idf term weighting uses the total number of documents in the document set and the number of documents in the document set that contain each term to extract a result.

Once we finished with tfIdf the dataset was ready for document-level multi-label classification. Below is multi-label confusion matrix for each class, using a LinearSVC for training and prediction.
